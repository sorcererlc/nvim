These are my configuration files for NeoVim.

Feel free to use them as a starting point for your own setup.


Originally inspired by [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) but as I started to learn more about NeoVim, the available plugins and the way they are set up I started reorganising things more to my liking and decided to make it its own thing instead of a kickstart fork.
