These are my configuration files for NeoVim. Feel free to use them as a starting point for your own setup.
Very much work in progress.

Originally inspired by kickstart.nvim but as I started to learn more about NeoVim, the available plugins and the way they are set up I started reorganising things more to my liking and decided to make it its own thing instead of a kickstart fork.

Credits in alphabetical order:
* [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) for giving me a working setup and getting me started on the NeoVim path
* [LunarVim](https://github.com/lunarvim/lunarvim) for some ideas about making the configuration modular
